<h1><span class="sp1">DEAD<br />
MAN'S<br />
PLANET</span></h1>

<div class="bk1"><h2>By WILLIAM MORRISON</h2>

<p class="p1"><big><b>Illustrated by EMSH</b></big></p>

<p><big><b><i>When a driven man arrives at
a cemetery world, what else
can it be but journey's end&mdash;and
the start of a new one?</i></b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Outside</span> the ship, it was
the sun that blazed angrily.
Inside, it was Sam
Wilson's temper. "Study your
lessons," he snarled, with a savageness
that surprised himself,
"or I'll never let you set foot on
this planet at all."</p>

<p>"Okay, Pop," said Mark, a little
white around the nostrils. He
looked old for so young a kid. "I
didn't mean anything wrong."</p>

<p>"I don't care what you meant.
You do as you're told."</p>

<p>In the quiet that followed,
broken only by the hum of the
arithmetic-tape, Sam wondered
at himself. As kids went, Mark
had never been a nuisance. Certainly
Rhoda had never had any
trouble with him. But Rhoda
had been altogether different.
Sam was tough and he had always
got a sense of satisfaction
out of knowing that he was hard-boiled.
Or at least that was once
true. Rhoda had been sweet, gentle....</p>

<p>He aroused himself from
thoughts of her by calling,
"Mark!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Pop?"</p>

<p>His voice had been harsher
than he had intended. Over the
past few weeks he seemed gradually
to have been losing control of
it. Now, although he was going
to do his son a favor, he sounded
like a slavemaster threatening a
beating. "You can shut off your
arithmetic lesson. We're going
out."</p>

<p>"But didn't you want me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I changed my mind."</p>

<p>Mark seemed more troubled
than pleased, as if a father who
changed his mind so readily was
a man to be wary of.</p>

<p><i>I'm on edge all the time</i>,
thought Sam, <i>and I'm getting
him that way, too. I'll have to regain
control of myself.</i></p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> had long ago made all the
necessary tests for such possible
dangers as lack of oxygen
and the presence of infectious organisms.
On all counts, the planet
had passed muster. The sun,
whiter than Sol, was almost hot
enough to make him forget the
chill he carried deep inside him.
Almost, but not quite, especially
as the air, though breathable,
was thin and deficient in nitrogen.
The countryside was bleak,
inspiring in him the thought that
there are two kinds of desolation;
the one that precedes the coming
of Man, and the one which he
knows only too well how to create
wherever he goes. The desolation
here was non-human.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it's like a cemetery, ain't
it, Pop?"</p>

<p>Sam looked at his son sharply.
Kids of ten were not supposed to
know much about cemeteries.
Nor, for that matter, were kids
of six, Mark's age when the funeral
had taken place. Sam
hadn't let him attend, but evidently
the incident had made a
deeper impression on his mind
than Sam had realized. He would
always remember a cemetery as
the place where his mother lived.
Perhaps he missed Rhoda almost
as much as his father did.</p>

<p>"It's different from a cemetery,"
said Sam. "There's nobody
buried here. Looks like we're the
first human beings ever to set
foot on this place."</p>

<p>"Do you think we'll find animals
to catch, Pop?"</p>

<p>"I don't see signs of any animals."</p>

<p>That was part of Sam's private
fiction, that he was looking for
strange animals to be sold to
zoos or circuses. Actually he was
seeking less to find anything new
than to lose something he carried
with him, and succeeding in
neither attempt.</p>

<p>Mark shivered in the sun. "It's
kind of lonely," he said.</p>

<p>"More lonely than the ship?"</p>

<p>"It's different. It's bigger, so
it's more lonely."</p>

<p><i>I'm not so sure</i>, argued Sam
mentally. <i>In the ship, we have
all of space around us, and nothing's
bigger than that. Still, your
opinion has to be respected.
You're almost as great an expert
on the various kinds of loneliness
as I am. The difference is that
you're loneliest when you're
away from people. I'm loneliest
in a crowd. That's why I don't
mind this planet so much.</i></p>

<p>He walked ahead, Mark following
almost reluctantly. The
ground was rocky and the shrub-like
vegetation sparse and stunted,
ranging in color from greenish
gray to brown. It seemed hardly
capable of supporting a large
animal population. If there were
any animals here at all, they
were probably too small to be
impressive, and would be of little
interest to exhibitors.</p>

<p>They walked in silence for a
few moments, and then Sam
asked, "Want to go on?"</p>

<p>"I want to finish my studying."</p>

<p>That was something new.
"Okay," said Sam, and turned
back.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> were approaching the
ship when the sound of a pebble
falling came to Sam's ears.
Automatically, his hand reached
for his gun, and he swung around
to face what might be danger. As
he did so, something snarled and
fled. He could see no sign of motion,
but he could hear the scattering
of other pebbles along a
gully as the creature retreated.</p>

<p>"Looks like we're not alone
here, after all," he said. "Wonder
what that was."</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been very
big," said Mark. "Big animals
don't run away."</p>

<p>"Not usually, unless they're
smart, or they've met people before.
I'll have to set traps."</p>

<p>"Do you think maybe if you
caught him you could sell him
to a circus, Pop?"</p>

<p>"I'll have to see what he's like,
first," said Sam. He looked
around. "If there's one animal,
there are likely to be others. It's
strange that I didn't detect any
sign of them."</p>

<p>He put his arm absently over
Mark's shoulder. He didn't notice
the expression on the kid's
face at this unexpected gesture.</p>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/001.png" width="357" height="500" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>When they were inside the ship
again, Mark said, "Guess I'd better
get back to my arithmetic."</p>

<p>"In a minute," said Sam. "I
want to talk to you first." He
dropped wearily into a seat, although
he had done nothing that
should have tired him out. His
son looked at him expectantly.
"Mark, do you like traveling
around with me?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Pop, I like to be with
you."</p>

<p>"Not seeing anybody else? No
other kids, no people of any
kind? Just being with me, learning
your lessons from tapes, and
having your test papers corrected
automatically? You don't get
tired of it?"</p>

<p>Mark hesitated despite himself.
Then he said loyally, "I'd
rather be with you than anybody
else. When Mom&mdash;when Mom
died&mdash;I didn't want to see anybody."</p>

<p>"I know how you felt. But that
was four years ago. You can't
grow up alone. Now what you
need to do is meet people, learn
how they talk and think and feel.
You can't learn those things
from tapes, and you can't learn
them from me."</p>

<p>Mark said stubbornly, "I like
to be with you."</p>

<p>"I'm not much of a person to
be with. Don't think I don't
know it. I'm mean and surly, and
my temper's getting worse by the
day. I can't associate with people
any more. But <i>you</i> can. I was
thinking maybe I'd leave you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" cried Mark.</p>

<p>"Not in an orphanage or anything
like that. But I have some
friends whose kids are growing
up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. I won't go. If you send
me, I'll run away. I want to be
with you."</p>

<p>"Okay," said Sam. "That's
that."</p>

<p>But it wasn't, and he knew it.
Even as he went about preparing
his traps, he knew it.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">As</span> it turned out, the only animals
he caught in his traps
were small ones which tore themselves
in two and then scampered
off, each half running in a different
direction. For the animal
which had made those noises, no
traps were necessary. Later on he
heard a noise outside again, and
he went out cautiously, gun in
hand. The animal backed away,
but he saw it, then he heard it
bark. So did Mark, who had followed
him.</p>

<p>Mark's eyes almost popped.
It was four years since he had
heard the sound, but he knew at
once what it was. "Gosh! A dog!
How do you s'pose he got here?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Sam.
"Your guess is as good as mine."</p>

<p>"But if we're the first human
beings to land here&mdash;it ain't possible!"</p>

<p>"I know that. But there he is."</p>

<p>At the sound of their voices,
the dog broke into a series of furious
barks, backing away as it
did so.</p>

<p>"What kind is he, Pop?"</p>

<p>"He looks like a mongrel to
me. A bad-tempered, medium-sized
mongrel with an ugly look
about him. Maybe I ought to
shoot him and get it over with."</p>

<p>"Shoot him? Don't do that! I
want him as a pet."</p>

<p>"He looks too wild to make
much of a pet."</p>

<p>The dog gave one last bark of
defiance, turned, and fled in the
same general direction, Sam noticed,
as he had run last time.</p>

<p>"Maybe dogs <i>do</i> grow on other
planets, Pop."</p>

<p>"Only if men have brought
them there."</p>

<p>"Then that means there was a
ship here?"</p>

<p>"At some time or other there
was a ship. I don't think it was
smashed up, or I'd have seen
wreckage when I cruised around
before landing. That dog was
either left here by mistake, or deliberately
marooned."</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;maybe he's with
somebody who's still here."</p>

<p>"Not likely," said Sam thoughtfully.
"He wanders around too
freely, and he seems unused to
the presence of human beings.
Besides, no men would be likely
to live here long without shelter.
And I've seen no sign of any house
or hut."</p>

<p>"Could he belong to a being
that wasn't human?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Sam with certainty.
"Only human beings have
been able to domesticate dogs. If
a dog is here, a human being was
once here. That's definite."</p>

<p>"He <i>would</i> make a good pet,"
said Mark longingly.</p>

<p>"Not that one. Maybe I should
have got you a dog long ago. It
might have been just the kind of
companionship you needed. But
you can't make a pet of this animal.
He's been away from people
too long, and he's developed
some mean habits." And he added
mentally, "<i>Like me.</i>"</p>

<p>"I could train him," said Mark.
"He wouldn't be any trouble at
all, Pop. I'd train him and feed
him, and he'd be just like one of
us. And&mdash;and like you say, Pop,
it wouldn't be so lonely for me."</p>

<p>Kids don't give up easily,
thought Sam. All the same, he
had an idea that with this dog
all the persistence in the world
would be useless. He shrugged,
and said simply, "We'll see."
And then they went into the ship
to eat.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">All</span> through the meal he could
tell that Mark was thinking
about the dog. The boy's
thoughts seemed to affect his appetite.
For the first time, he left
some of his proteinex on the
plate.</p>

<p>"I'm not very hungry today,"
he said apologetically. "Maybe&mdash;"
He looked inquiringly at
his father.</p>

<p>"Go ahead and finish it," said
Sam. "We've got plenty of food.
I'll fix up something else for the
dog."</p>

<p>"But I want to feed him myself,
Pop. I want him to get used
to me feeding him."</p>

<p>"I'll give you your chance
later."</p>

<p>Afterwards, Sam thriftily
opened an old can of a less expensive
variety of proteinex and
put half of it on a platter, which
Mark carried outside the ship.
He moved off about a hundred
yards in the direction the dog
had taken, and set the platter
down on a rock.</p>

<p>"The wind is blowing the
wrong way," said Sam. "Let's
wait a while."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> ten minutes the wind shifted,
and if the dog was near,
Sam felt certain that he had
picked up both their scent and
that of the food. That his feeling
was correct was shown by the
sudden appearance of the animal,
who barked again, but this
time not so fiercely. And he
stopped barking to sniff hungrily,
at the same time keeping his distance.</p>

<p>"Here, mutt," called Mark.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he won't come any
closer while we're around," said
Sam. "If you want him to have
that food, you'd better go away
from it."</p>

<p>Mark reluctantly backed away
with his father. The dog approached
the food, finally rushing
down upon it as if he feared
it would escape, and gobbled it.</p>

<p>In the days that followed, they
continued to feed him, and the
animal became relatively tame.
He stopped barking at them, and
at times let Mark come within a
few feet of him. But he never
allowed Mark to come close
enough to touch him, and he was
especially wary of Sam. The latter
could see, however, that there
was nothing around the smooth-furred
neck. The collar, if it had
ever existed, had evidently been
worn away.</p>

<p>"So we can't find out what his
name is," said Mark in disappointment.
"Here, Prince, here,
Spot, here, Rover&mdash;"</p>

<p>The animal answered to none
of the traditional dog names, nor
to several of the newer ones that
Mark recalled.</p>

<p>After the dog had been with
them for a half hour or so he
usually trotted off in the direction
of what they had come to
consider his lair.</p>

<p>"He doesn't seem to be getting
tame enough for a pet," said
Sam. "That's one idea I'm afraid
you'll have to give up."</p>

<p>"All he needs is a little more
time," said Mark. "He's getting
used to me." Then a sudden fear
struck him, and he added,
"You're not going to leave here
yet, are you, Pop? I thought you
wanted to catch some big animals."</p>

<p>"There aren't any other big
animals," replied Sam. "Just
those small ones who came apart
in the traps, and they're not
worth catching. But I'll stay.
This place is as good as any
other. I won't leave it yet."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> fact, the stay on the planet,
bleak as the place was, seemed
to be less unpleasant than cruising
aimlessly through space.
Mark had been starved for companionship
of someone besides
his father, and in a way, without
making too many demands,
the dog was a companion. Wondering
about the beast and trying
to tame him gave them
something with which to occupy
their minds. It had been several
days, realized Sam, since he had
last snapped at Mark.</p>

<p>It had become quite certain
now that there was no other human
being around. The dog's
eagerness for the food showed
that no one else had taken care
of him for a long time. Evidently
he had been forced to feed himself
on the small and elusive native
animals which he could run
down.</p>

<p>One of the things that puzzled
Sam was the dog's obvious anxiety
to leave the neighborhood of
the ship after a short period and
return to his lair. And one day,
driven by curiosity, Sam followed
him, with Mark coming
along, too.</p>

<p>The dog had become sufficiently
accustomed to them by
now not to resent their presence,
and it was easy to keep him in
sight. He led the way for at least
two miles, over rocky ground and
past a small stream. Quite unexpectedly
he stopped and began to
whine and sniff the ground. As
Sam and Mark approached, he
turned on them, barking furiously.</p>

<p>The man and boy exchanged
glances. "He's acting just like he
did in the beginning," said Mark.</p>

<p>"There's something in the
ground," said Sam. "I'm going to
find out what it is." And he drew
his gun.</p>

<p>"You're not going to kill him,
Pop!"</p>

<p>"I'll just put him to sleep. An
anaesthetic pellet of the kind I
use for trapping ought to do the
trick."</p>

<p>But one pellet turned out to be
not enough. It required the
bursting of three pellets before
the animal finally trembled,
came to a halt, and with eyes
glazed, fell over on the ground.</p>

<p>When they approached closer,
Sam caught sight of half a dozen
stones, roughly piled together.
He said, "Better get back, Mark.
This may not be pleasant."</p>

<p>"You think&mdash;you think somebody's
buried here?"</p>

<p>"Very likely. I'm going to see."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Using</span> a flat rock with a sharp
edge as an improvised spade,
he began to dig. The ground was
hard, and the rock was not the
best of tools. It took him half an
hour to reach the first bone, and
another half-hour to uncover the
rest.</p>

<p>Mark had come up behind him
and was watching with no sign of
revulsion. He said, "I&mdash;I was
afraid there might be a body,
Pop."</p>

<p>"So was I. It looks as if the
man died so long ago that everything
else has rotted away, except
for a few metal clasps. No
other sign of shoes or clothes.
And no indication of how this
happened."</p>

<p>"You think he was the dog's
master?"</p>

<p>"Evidently."</p>

<p>They both stared at the sleeping
animal. Then Sam shrugged,
and began to fill the shallow
grave again. Mark helped him
push in the dirt and stamp it
down into place. Finally they
moved the stones back.</p>

<p>They were about to leave when
Mark cried out, "Look at that
rock!"</p>

<p>Staring where his son pointed,
Sam saw a gray column about
four feet high, with four smooth
lateral sides. Rectangular prisms
of this size were rare in nature.
This was obviously the work of
human hands, and of a blasting
rod as well, to judge by the sides,
which showed evidence of having
been fused before weathering had
cut into them. At first he had
thought the column was a gravestone.
But there was no inscription
upon it. There was nothing
but a thin deep groove that ran
horizontally around the four
sides, several inches from the top.</p>

<p>"What does it mean, Pop?"</p>

<p>"Let's find out. It's obviously
been put here as some sort of
memorial. As for this groove&mdash;"</p>

<p>He put his hands on the top of
the stone and lifted. As he had
half expected, it separated at the
horizontal groove. The top of the
stone was the lid of a box. Inside
lay a plastic container.</p>

<p>"Some kind of plastic we don't
make any more," muttered Sam.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to open it?"
asked Mark eagerly. "Maybe it
tells about the grave and the
dog's name."</p>

<p>The plastic came open at a
slight tug. Inside were several
strong sheets of paper. Sam
stared at them and said, "It's
writing, sure enough. But in some
language I don't understand."</p>

<p>"We can put it in our mechanical
translator," said Mark.
"That can tell us what it means."</p>

<p>"That's what we'll do."</p>

<p>"Aren't we going to take the
dog with us, Pop?"</p>

<p>"No, we'll leave him here. He'll
come to in a little while."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Walking</span> back to their ship,
Mark continued to show an
excitement that was unusual for
him. "You know what?" he said.
"I'll bet we're going to learn what
the dog's name is."</p>

<p>"I doubt if whoever wrote this
thing would bother about a trifle
like that."</p>

<p>"But that's important. You'll
see, Pop, you'll see!"</p>

<p>At the ship, Sam inserted the
sheets into the reader section of
his translator and started the motor.
The selector swung into action.</p>

<p>"Before it can translate, it has
to decide what language this is,"
he explained.</p>

<p>"Will that take long?"</p>

<p>"A few minutes if we're lucky,
a couple of hours if we're not.
After that, I think the translation
itself shouldn't take more than a
few minutes. While we're waiting,
we might as well eat."</p>

<p>"I'm not hungry," said Mark.</p>

<p>"You'd better eat anyway."</p>

<p>"Just a little bit, maybe. You
know what I think, Pop? When
I call the dog by his name, he'll
know I'm his friend and he'll
come to me. Then he'll really be
my pet."</p>

<p>"Don't count too much on it,"
said Sam. And thought once
more how lonely his son must be,
to center so much hope in a half-wild
beast.</p>

<p>A light glowed suddenly in the
translator. The selector had
found the proper language. Now
it began to translate.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, its work
had been completed. As Sam silently
began to read, Mark
bumped against him, knocking
the translation from his hand.
Sam's first reaction was anger at
the boy's clumsiness. Then he
became aware of the hope and
the fear that lay behind Mark's
excitement, and bit back the
angry words which had almost
reached his lips.</p>

<p>"Easy, Mark, easy," he said.
He picked up the translation
again and sat down. "You can
read it over my shoulder, if you
want to."</p>

<p>"I just want to find out the
dog's name."</p>

<p>"The important thing is his
master's name. Julian Hagstrom,
it says. And he was on a spaceship
with his brother, Raoul."</p>

<p>Mark's eyes had skipped
ahead. "Look, Pop, here's the
dog's name&mdash;Arkem! I never
heard of a dog having a name
like that! What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't know," muttered
Sam absently, still reading.</p>

<p>But Mark wasn't actually interested
in his answer. He ran
outside. "Arkem!" he called.
"Arkem!"</p>

<p>There was nothing he could interpret
as an answer. After a moment
or two he came into the
ship again, his face betraying his
disappointment. "I guess he
doesn't hear me. He's too far
away."</p>

<p>Sam nodded. He had put the
translation down and was staring
straight ahead of him, as if
looking through the ship's side.</p>

<p>"Is anything the matter, Pop?"</p>

<p>"What? Oh, no, nothing's the
matter. I was just thinking about
what I read here."</p>

<p>"They had an accident, didn't
they? How did it happen?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"It</span> happened because their
ship wasn't as good as ours.
Julian Hagstrom, the man who
was killed, was buried here by
his brother. Raoul put this record
in the stone to mark his
grave. I think he also engraved
something on the stone itself.
But that's been worn away."</p>

<p>"It must have been a long time
ago. Maybe years."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was years ago. After
he buried Julian, Raoul tried to
make repairs, and headed in a
direction where he hoped he'd
find a civilized planet. He never
made it."</p>

<p>"How can you know that? He
wrote the paper <i>before</i> he started
out."</p>

<p>"If he had made it, we'd have
heard of him. We'd certainly
have heard of him." Sam's face
was bleak. "And Rhoda&mdash;your
mother&mdash;would still be alive."</p>

<p>Mark looked puzzled, and
stared at the translation once
more. "It says here he tried to
re-reverse the aging process.
What does that mean? And
what's immortality, Pop?"</p>

<p>"Something he and his brother
were looking for. Something to
keep people from ever dying.
They had a ship full of dogs and
other animals. All died in their
experiments&mdash;all but Arkem.
They had high hopes of Arkem.
He lived through a number of
different treatments and became
quite a pet of Julian's. Then
came the crash. Their method
wasn't proof against accidental
death, and at any rate they
hadn't applied it yet to themselves.</p>

<p>"After Raoul buried his brother,
the dog was miserable, and
howled so much that Raoul decided
to leave him behind. He
was helped to reach this decision
by the fact that the ship had lost
much of its air in the accident,
and he knew that the air-purifying
mechanism wasn't working
too well. He figured he'd have a
better chance of surviving if he
stayed in the ship alone. But it
didn't do him any good. He was
lost in space, or we'd certainly
have heard of him."</p>

<p>From outside there came the
sound of a low growl. "It's Arkem!"
cried Mark. "Now you'll
see. Wait till he hears me call his
name."</p>

<p>He ran out, and Sam followed
slowly. "Don't expect too much,
Mark," he said, almost with pity.</p>

<p>Mark didn't hear him. "Arkem!"
he called. "Arkem! Arkem!"</p>

<p>The dog was watchful, keeping
his distance and giving no sign
of recognition. Sam put his arm
around his son's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Arkem, Arkem! Here, Arkem!"</p>

<p>The dog snarled.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There</span> were tears in the boy's
eyes. "He doesn't know his
own name! He doesn't even know
his own name! Arkem!"</p>

<p>"It's no use, Mark, he's forgotten
he ever had a name. I'm
afraid you'd better give up the
idea of having him as a pet."</p>

<p>"But you <i>can't</i> forget your
own name!"</p>

<p>"You can in eight hundred
years. Yes, Mark, that's when all
this happened, eight hundred
years ago. That's why the language
had to be translated.
Arkem is immortal. And during
his long life he's forgotten not
only his name, but the master for
whose sake he was marooned
here. If Julian Hagstrom were,
by some miracle, to come back
to life, I'm sure the dog wouldn't
remember him. All he has is a
vague but strong tie to that heap
of stones. He no longer knows
why he's protecting it. He's been
away from live human beings so
long that his brain is little more
than a bundle of reflexes and instincts."</p>

<p>"I'll train him," said Mark.
"Sometimes you forget a thing
at first, but it comes back to you
later. He'll remember his name&mdash;here,
Arkem!"</p>

<p>"It's no use," said Sam. "For
eight hundred years he's been
tied to that heap of stones. He'll
never remember anything except
that fact. I'll get you another dog
for a pet."</p>

<p>"You mean we're going back
to Mars or Earth?"</p>

<p>"Some place like that. Some
place where there are people.
Being alone in space is no good
for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Pop, you can't get rid
of me like that."</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to get rid of
you," said Sam. "Being alone in
space is no good for me either.
I'm going with you."</p>

<p>"Gee, are you sure? You won't
change your mind?"</p>

<p>The delighted but uncertain
look on his son's face shook Sam.
He said carefully, "I won't
change my mind. I've decided
that it's possible to have too much
of a good thing. If grief is a good
thing."</p>

<p>Suddenly, for no reason that
they could detect, the dog barked
at them and backed away, the
fur rising in an angry ridge along
his back.</p>

<p>"Couldn't we take him along
anyway?" asked Mark. "I don't
like to think of him all alone
here, year after year."</p>

<p>"He'll be miserable here, but
he'd be more miserable away
from his heap of dirt and stones.
Perhaps&mdash;" Mark didn't see as
Sam pulled his gun, then let it
slip back into place. "No. That's
none of my business. Maybe he'll
be fortunate and have an accident."</p>

<p>"What did you say, Pop?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much. Come along,
Mark. We're heading for civilization."</p>

<p>An hour later, the ship rose
into the air. Through the blasting
of the rockets, Sam thought&mdash;imagined,
he decided, was a better
word&mdash;that he heard the long
doleful whine of a creature whose
mindless grief was doomed to
last for all eternity.</p>
